üí° Approach & Logic
	‚Ä¢	The app uses react-window‚Äôs FixedSizeList for rendering only visible list items to improve performance.
	‚Ä¢	useState and useEffect are used for state management.
	‚Ä¢	Features like bulk actions and theme toggle are handled with simple boolean flags and filters.
	‚Ä¢	Design is kept clean and minimal using custom CSS and class-based themes (dark / light).
